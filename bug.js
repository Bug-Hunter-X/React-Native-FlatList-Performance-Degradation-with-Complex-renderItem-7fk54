This React Native bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and a custom `renderItem` function that performs complex calculations or manipulations.  The issue manifests as significant performance degradation or even app crashes, especially on lower-end devices. The root cause often lies in inefficient rendering or data processing within the `renderItem` function, leading to dropped frames and UI freezes. This is often worsened by inefficient state management or the use of computationally expensive operations inside the render loop.
